# 🎭 RoastX

RoastX is a fun web-based application that generates witty and sarcastic responses targeting a user's X (Twitter) profile, based on the username provided. The project uses Gemini AI to create unique, entertaining roasts.

RoastX is inspired by the [Roastgram](https://github.com/syahrulnizam7/roastgram) project created by [syahrulnizam7](https://github.com/syahrulnizam7) but with some differences: while Roastgram utilizes JavaScript and targets Instagram, RoastX is built using PHP and is designed to generate roasts based on X (formerly Twitter) profiles.
